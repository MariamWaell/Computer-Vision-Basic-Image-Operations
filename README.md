# Computer Vision Basic Image Processing
- Filters, Histograms, Gradients, Frequency

## Functions Files
- Filters.py : this includes the implementation for filtration functions.
- Frequency.py : this includes the implementation for local and global thresholding, normalization, and equalization functions.
- Histograms.py : this includes the implementation for getting a hybrid image.

## Images folder 
- contains images to test your implementation.

## GUI 
- Project.py : this includes streamlit Layout.
Contains three tabs:
- Tab 1 : load and show input image, choose a filter from list of available filters, determine filter parameters, apply the fiter then show the output image.
- Tab 2 : load and show input image, calculate and plot input image histogram.
- Tab 3 : load input image A, load input image B, make and show hybrid image.
